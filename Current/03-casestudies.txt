=== Hospital Billing (Steve Doig, Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication) ===

image::Figures/03-AA.png[width=600]

Investigative reporters at http://californiawatch.org/[CaliforniaWatch] received tips that a large chain of hospitals in California might be systematically gaming the federal Medicare program that pays for the costs of medical treatments of Americans aged 65 or older. The particular scam that was alleged is called ``upcoding'', which means reporting patients having more complicated conditions - worth higher reimbursement - than actually existed. But a key source was a union that was fighting with the hospital chain's management, and the CaliforniaWatch team knew that independent verification was necessary for the story to have credibility.

Luckily, California's department of health has public records that give very detailed information about each case treated in all the state's hospitals. The 128 variables include up to 25 diagnosis codes from the "International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems" manual (commonly known as ICD-9) published by the World Health Organization. While patients aren't identified by name in the data, other variables tell the age of the patient, how the costs are paid and which hospital treated him or her. The reporters realized that with these records, they could see if the hospitals owned by the chain were reporting certain unusual conditions at significantly higher rates than were being seen at other hospitals.

The data sets were large - nearly 4 million records per year, and the reporters wanted to study six years worth of records in order to see how patterns changed over time. They ordered the data from the state agency; it arrived on CD-ROMs that were easily copied into a desktop computer. The reporter doing the actual data analysis used a system called http://www.sas.com/[SAS] to work with the data. SAS is very powerful (allowing analysis of many millions of records) and is used by many government agencies, including the California health department, but it is expensive - the same kind of analysis could have been done using any of a variety of other database tools, such as Microsoft Access or the open-source http://www.mysql.com/[MySQL].

With the data in hand and the programs written to study it, finding suspicious patterns was relatively simple. For example, one allegation was that the chain was reporting various degrees of malnutrition at much higher rates than were seen at other hospitals. Using SAS, the data analyst extracted frequency tables that showed the numbers of malnutrition cases being reported each year by each of California's more than 300 acute care hospitals. The raw frequency tables then were imported into Microsoft Excel for closer inspection of the patterns for each hospital; Excel's ability to sort, filter and calculate rates from the raw numbers made seeing the patterns easy.

Particularly striking were reports of a condition called Kwashiorkor, a protein deficiency syndrome that almost exclusively is seen in starving infants in famine-afflicted developing countries. Yet the chain was reporting its hospitals were diagnosing Kwashiorkor among elderly Californians http://californiawatch.org/health-and-welfare/hospital-chain-already-under-scrutiny-reports-high-malnutrition-rates-8786[at rates as much as 70 times] higher than the state average of all hospitals.

For other stories, the analysis used similar techniques to http://californiawatch.org/health-and-welfare/prime-healthcares-treatment-rare-ailments-stands-out-13021[examine the reported rates] of conditions like septicemia, encephalopathy, malignant hypertension and autonomic nerve disorder. And another analysis http://californiawatch.org/health-and-welfare/chain-profits-admitting-er-patients-11561[looked at allegations] that the chain was admitting from its emergency rooms into hospital care unusually high percentages of Medicare patients, whose source of payment for hospital care is more certain than is the case for many other emergency room patients.

To summarize, stories like these become possible when you use data to produce evidence to test independently allegations being made by sources who may have their own agendas. These stories also are a good example of the necessity for strong public records laws; the reason the government requires hospitals to report this data is so that these kinds of analyses can be done, whether by government, academics, investigators or even citizen journalists. The subject of these stories is important because it examines whether millions of dollars of public money is being spent properly.

=== Care Home Crisis (Cynthia O'Murchu, Financial Times) ===

A http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/920fcd2c-8aca-11e0-b2f1-00144feab49a.html[Financial Times investigation] into the quality of care provided in care homes began with a simple question: is care provided by private providers better than that offered by the non-profit sector or the government?

The analysis was timely, because the financial problems of Southern Cross, then the country's largest care home operator, were coming to a head. The government had for decades promoted a privatisation drive in the care sector and continued to tout the private sector for its astute business practices.

Our inquiry began with analysing data we obtained from the UK regulator in charge of inspecting care homes. The information was public, but it required a lot of persistence to get the data in a form that was usable.

The data included ratings (now defunct) on individual homes' performance and a breakdown of whether they were private, government-owned or non-profit. The Care Quality Commission (CQC), up to June 2010, rated care homes on quality ranging from a verdict of "zero stars - poor" to "three stars - excellent".

The first step required extensive data cleaning, as the data provided by the Care Quality Commission for example contained categorisations that were not uniform. This was primarily done using Excel. We also determined - through desk and phone research - whether particular homes were owned by private-equity groups. Before the financial crisis, the care home sector was a magnet for private equity and property investors, but several - such as Southern Cross - had begun to face serious financial difficulties. We wanted to establish what effect, if any, private equity ownership had on quality of care.

A relatively straight forward set of Excel calculations enabled us to establish that the non-profit and government-run homes on average performed significantly better than the private sector. Some private equity-owned care home groups performed well over average, and others well below average.

Paired with on-the-ground reporting, case studies of neglect, an in-depth look at the failures in regulatory policies as well as other data on levels of pay, turnover rates etc, our analysis was able to paint a picture of the true state of elderly care.

Some tips:

  * Make sure you keep notes on how you manipulate the original data.
  * Keep a copy of the original data and never change the original.
  * Check and double check the data. Do the analysis several times (if need be from scratch).
  * If you mention particular companies or individuals, give them a right to reply.

=== A 9 Month Investigation into European Structural Funds (Cynthia O'Murchu, Financial Times) ===

////

Insert: picture from project

////

In 2010, the Financial Times and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism (BIJ) joined forces to investigate European Structural Funds. The intention was to review who the beneficiaries of European Structural Funds are and check whether the money was put to good use. At €347bn over seven years Structural Funds is the second largest subsidy programme in the EU. The programme has existed for decades, but apart from broad, generalised overviews, there was little transparency about who the beneficiaries are. As part of a rule change in the current funding round, authorities are obliged to make public a list of beneficiaries, including project description and amount of EU and national funding received.

The project was done with up to 12 journalists and one coder and took nine months. Data gathering alone took many months. The project resulted in five days of coverage in the Financial Times and the BIJ, a BBC radio documentary, and several TV documentaries.

Before you tackle a project of this level of effort, you have to be certain that the findings are original, and that you will end up with good stories nobody else has.

The process was broken up into a number of distinct steps:

*1. Identify who keeps the data and how it is kept*

The European Commission's Directorate General for the Regions have a http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/index_en.cfm[portal] to the websites of regional authorities that publish the data. We believed that the Commission would have an overarching database of project data that we could either access directly, or which we could obtain through a Freedom of Information request. No such database exists to the level of detail we required. We quickly realised that many of the links the Commission provided were faulty and that most of the authorities published the data in PDF format, rather than analysis-friendly formats such as CSV or XML.

A team of up to 12 people worked on identifying the latest data and collating the links into one large spreadsheet we used for collaboration. Since the data fields were not uniform (for example headers were in different languages, some data sets used different currencies, some included breakdowns of EU and National Funding) we needed to be as precise as possible in translating and describing the data fields available in each data set.

*2. Download and prepare the data*

The next step consisted of downloading all the spreadsheets, PDFs and, in some cases, web scraping the original data.

Each data set had to then be standardised. Our biggest task was extracting data out of PDFs, some hundreds of pages long. Much of this was done using UnPDF and ABBYY FineReader, which allow data to be extracted to formats such as CSV or Excel.

It also involved checking and double checking that the PDF extraction tools had captured the data correctly. This was done using filtering, sorting and summing up totals (to ensure it corresponded with what was printed on the PDFs).

*3. Create a database*

The team's coder set up a SQL database. Each of the files prepared were then used as a building block for the overall SQL database. A once a day process would upload all the individual data files into one large SQL database, which could be queried on the fly through its front end by using queries. 

*4. Double-checking and analysis*

The team analysed the data in two main ways:

a. via the database front end. This entailed typing particular keywords of interest (e.g. "tobacco", "hotel", "company A" in to the search engine. With help of Google Translate, which was plugged into the search functionality of our database, those keywords would be translated into 21 languages and would return appropriate results. These could be downloaded and reporters could do further research on the individual projects of interest.

b. macro-analysis using the whole database. Occasionally, we would download a full data set, which could then be analysed for example using keywords, or aggregating data by country, region, type of expenditure, number of projects by beneficiary etc.

Our story lines were informed by both these analyses, but also through on the ground and desk research.

Double-checking the intergrity of the data (by aggregating and checking against what authorities said had been allocated) took a substantial amount of time. One of the main problems was that authorities would for the most part only divulge the amount of "EU and national funding". Under EU rules, each programme is allowed to fund a certain percentage of the total cost using EU funding. The level of EU funding is determined, at programme level, by the so-called co-financing rate. Each programme (e.g. regional competitiveness) is made up of numerous projects. At the project levels, technically one project could receive 100 per cent EU funding, and another none at all, as long as grouped together, the amount of EU funding at the programme level is not more than the approved co-financing rate.

This meant that we needed to check each EU amount of funding we cited in our stories with the beneficiary company in question.

=== The Tell-All Telephone (Sascha Venohr, ZEIT Online) ===

image::Figures/03-BB.png[width=600]

Most people's understanding of what can actually be done with the data provided by our mobile phones is theoretical; there were few real-world examples. That is why Malte Spitz from the German Green party decided to publish his own data. To access the information, he had to file a suit against telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom. The data is the basis for ZEIT Online's accompanying interactive map, were contained in a massive Excel document. Each of the 35,831 rows of the spreadsheet represent an instance when Spitz's mobile phone transferred information over a half-year period.

Seen individually, the pieces of data are mostly harmless. But taken together they provide what investigators call a profile - a clear picture of a person's habits and preferences, and indeed, of his or her life. This profile reveals when Spitz walked down the street, when he took a train, when he was in a plane. It shows that he mainly works in Berlin and which cities he visited. It shows when he was awake and when he slept.

To illustrate just how much detail from someone's life can be mined from this stored data, ZEIT ONLINE has "augmented" Spitz's information with records that anyone can access: the politician's tweets and blog entries were added to the information on his movements. It is the kind of process that any good investigator would likely use to profile a person under observation. ZEIT ONLINE decided to keep one part of Spitz's data record private, namely, whom he called and who called him. That kind of information would not only infringe on the privacy of many other people in his life, it would also, even if the numbers were encrypted, reveal much too much about Spitz (but government agents in the real world would have access to this information).

We were very happy to work with Lorenz Matzat and Michael Kreil from Open Data City to find a solution how to understand and extract the geolocation from the dataset. Every connection of Spitz's mobile phone has to be triangulated to the positions of the antenna pole. Every pole has three antennas, each covering 120º. The two programmers found out, that the saved position indicated the direction from the mast Spitz's mobile phone was connecting from.

Matching this with the positions of the poles-map of the http://emf2.bundesnetzagentur.de/karte.html[state-controlled agency] gave us the possibility to get his position for each of the 260,640 minutes during the 181 days and put it via API on a Google Map. Together with the in-house graphics and design team we created a great interface to navigate: By pushing the play button, you will set off on a trip through Malte Spitz's life.

After a very successful launch of the Project in Germany, we noticed that we were having very high traffic from outside Germany and decided to create an English version of the app. After earning the German Grimme Online Award, the project was honoured with an ONA Award in September 2011, the first time for a German news website.

=== Citizen Data Reporters (Amanda Rossi, Friends of Januária) ===

////

Insert: picture from project

////

Large newsrooms are not the only ones that can work on data-powered stories. Citizen reporters also have the opportunity to use data in their stories. The same skills that are useful for data journalists can also help ordinary citizens access data about their locality, and turn them into stories.

This was the primary motivation of the citizen media outreach project http://amigosdejanuaria.wordpress.com/[Friends of Januária], which began in September 2011. The project received a grant from http://rising.globalvoicesonline.org/[Rising Voices], the outreach arm of http://globalvoicesonline.org/[Global Voices Online], and received additional support from the organisation http://www.article19.org/[Article 19]. Between September and October 2011, a group of young residents of a small town in Brazil were trained in basic journalism techniques and budget monitoring. They also learned how to make Freedom of Information requests and access publicly available information from official databases on the Internet.

The pilot project took place in Januária, a small town of approximately 65,000 residents located in north of the state of Minas Gerais, which is one of the poorest regions of Brazil. The town is also renowned for the failure of its local politicians. In just six years (2004-2010), Januária had seven different mayors. Almost all of them were removed from office due to wrongdoing in their public administrations, including charges of corruption.

Small towns like Januária often fail to attract attention from the Brazilian media, which tends to focus on larger cities and state capitals. However, there is an opportunity for residents of small towns to become a potential ally in the monitoring of the public administration because they know the daily challenges facing their local communities better than anyone. With the Internet as another important ally, residents can now better access information such as budget information and other data about their towns.

After taking part in twelve workshops, some of the new citizen reporters from Januária began to demonstrate how this concept of accessing publicly available data in small towns can be put into practice. For example, Soraia Amorim, a 22 year-old citizen journalist, wrote a story about the number of doctors that are on the city payroll according to Federal Government data. However, she found that the official number did not correspond with the situation in the town. To write this story, Soraia had access to health data about her town, which is available online at the http://tabnet.datasus.gov.br/tabdata/cadernos/cadernosmap.htm[website of the Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS - Unique Health System)], a federal program that provides free medical assistance to the Brazilian population. According to SUS data, Januária should have 71 doctors in various health specialities.

The number of doctors indicated by SUS data did not match what she knew about doctors in the area: residents were always complaining about the lack of doctors and some patients had to travel to neighbouring towns to see a doctor. Later, Soraia interviewed a woman that had recently been in a motorcycle accident and could not find medical assistance at Januária's hospital because no doctor was available. She also talked to the town's Health Secretary, who admitted that there were less doctors in town than the number published by SUS.

These initial findings raise many questions about reasons for this difference between the official information published online and the town's reality. One of them is that the federal data may be wrong, which would mean that there is an important lack of health information in Brazil. Another possibility may be that the town is incorrectly reporting the information to SUS. Both of these possibilities should lead to a deeper investigation to find the definitive answer. However, Soraia's story is an important part of this chain because it highlights an inconsistency and may also encourage others to look more closely about this issue.

"I used to live in the countryside, and finished high school with a lot of difficulty" says Soraia. "When people asked me what I wanted to do with my life, I always told them that I wanted to be a journalist. But I imagined that it was almost impossible due to the world I lived in." After taking part in the Friends of Januária training, Soraia believes that access to data is an important tool to change the reality of her town. "I feel able to help to change my town, my country, the world" she adds.

Another citizen journalist from the project is Alysson Montiériton, 20 years-old, who also used data for his final article. It was during the project's first class, when the citizen reporters walked around the city to look for subjects that could become stories, that Alysson decided to write about a broken traffic light located in a very important intersection, which had remained broken since the beginning of the year. After learning how to look for data on the Internet, Alysson searched for the number of vehicles that exists in town and the amount of taxes paid by those who own vehicles. He wrote:

____
The situation in Januária gets worse because of the high number of vehicles in town. According to IBGE (the most important statistics research institute in Brazil), Januária had 13,771 vehicles (among which 7,979 were motorcycles) in 2010. ... The town's residents believe that the delay in fixing the traffic light is not a result of lack of resources. According to the Treasury Secretary of Minas Gerais state, the town received 470 thousand reais in vehicle taxes in 2010.
____

By having access to data, Alysson was able to show that Januária has many vehicles (almost one for every five residents) and that a broken traffic light could put a lot of people in danger. Furthermore, he was able to tell his audience the amount of funds received by the town from taxes paid by vehicle owners and, based on that, to question whether this money would not be enough to repair the traffic light to provide safe conditions to drivers and pedestrians.

Although these two reports, written by Soraia and Alysson, are very simple, they show that data can be used by citizen reporters. You don't need to be in a large newsroom with lots of specialists to use data in your reports. After twelve workshops Soraia and Alysson, neither of whom have a background in journalism, were able to work on data powered stories and write interesting pieces about their local situation. In addition, their articles show that data itself can be useful even on a small scale. In other words, that there is also valuable information in small datasets and tables - not only in huge databases

=== Which Car Model? MOT Failure Rates (Martin Rosenbaum, BBC) ===

image::Figures/03-CC.png[width=600]

In January 2010 the BBC obtained data about the MOT pass and fail rates for different makes and models of cars. This is the test which assesses whether a car is safe and roadworthy - any car over three years old has to have an MOT test annually.

We obtained the data under freedom of information following an 18-month battle with VOSA, the Department for Transport agency which oversees the MOT system. VOSA turned down our FOI request for these figures on the grounds that it would breach commercial confidentiality. It argued that it could be 'commercially damaging' to vehicle manufacturers with high failure rates. However, we then appealed to the Information Commissioner, who ruled that disclosure of the information would be in the public interest. VOSA then released the data, 18 months after we asked for it.

We analysed the figures, focusing on the most popular models and comparing cars of the same age. This showed wide discrepancies. For example, among three year old cars, 28% of Renault Méganes failed their MOT in contrast to only 11% of Toyota Corollas. The figures were reported on television, radio and online.

The data was given to us in the form of a 1,200 page PDF document, which we then had to convert into a spreadsheet to do the analysis. As well as reporting our conclusions, we published this Excel spreadsheet (with over 14,000 lines of data) on the BBC News website http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/opensecrets/2010/01/mot_failure_rates_released.html[along with our story]. This gave everyone else access to the data in a usable form.

The result was that others then used this data for their own analyses which we did not have time to do in the rush to get the story out quickly or which in some cases would have stretched our technical capabilities at the time. This included examining the failure rates for cars of other ages, comparing the records of manufacturers rather than individual models, and creating searchable databases for looking up the results of individuals models. We added links to these sites to our online news story, so our readers could get the benefit of this work.

This illustrated some advantages of releasing the raw data to accompany a data-driven story. There may be exceptions (for example, if you are planning to use the data for other follow-up stories later and want to keep it to yourself meanwhile), but on the whole publishing the data has several important benefits.

1. Your job is to find things out and tell people about them. If you've gone to the trouble of obtaining all the data, it's part of your job to pass it on.

2. Other people may spot points of significant interest which you've missed, or simply details that matter to them even if they weren't important enough to feature in your story.

3. Others can build on your work with further, more detailed analysis of the data, or different techniques for presenting or visualising the figures, using their own ideas or technical skills which may probe the data productively in alternative ways.

4. It's part of incorporating accountability and transparency into the journalistic process. Others can understand your methods and check your working if they want to.

=== Finnish Parliamentary Elections and Campaign Funding (Esa Mäkinen, Helsingin Sanomat) ===

image::Figures/03-DD.png[width=600]

In the spring of 2012, there are many ongoing trials about the campaign election funding of Finnish general elections of 2007.

After the elections in 2007, the press found out that the laws on publicising campaign funding had no effect on politicians. Basically, campaign funding has been used to buy favours from politicians, who have then failed to declare their funding as mandated by Finnish law.

After these incidents, the laws became stricter. After the general election in March 2011, Helsingin Sanomat decided to carefully explore all the available data on campaign funding. The new law stipulates, that election funding must be declared and only donations below 1500 euros may be anonymous.

*STEP ONE: Find Data and Developers.*

Helsingin Sanomat has organized HS Open hackathons since March 2011. We invite Finnish coders, journalists and graphic designers to the basement of our building. Participants are divided into groups of three, and they are encouraged to develop applications and visualizations. We have had about 60 participants in each of our three events so far. We decided that campaign funding data should be the focus of HS Open #2, May 2011.

The National Audit Office of Finland is the authority that keeps records of campaign funding. That was the easy part. Chief information Officer, Jaakko Hamunen, built a website that provides real time access to their campaign funding database. The Audit Office made this in just two months after our request.

The http://www.vaalirahoitus.fi/[Vaalirahoitus.fi] website will provide the press and public information on campaign funding on every elections from now on.

*STEP TWO: Brainstorm for Ideas.*

The participants of HS Open 2 came up with twenty different prototypes about what to do with the data. You can find all the prototypes http://blogit.hs.fi/hsnext/hs-open-2-tuotti-parikymmenta-prototyyppia[on our website] (text in Finnish).

A bioinformatics researcher called Janne Peltola noted that campaign funding data looked like gene data they research in terms of containing many interdependencies. In bioinformatics there is an open source tool called http://www.cytoscape.org/[Cytoscape] which is used to map these interdependencies. So we ran the data through Cytoscape, and had a very interesting prototype.

*STEP THREE: Implement the Idea on Paper and on the Web.*

The law on campaign funding states that elected members of parliament must declare their funding two months after the elections. In practise this meant that we got the real data in mid-June. In HS Open, we had data only from MPs who had filed before the deadline.

There was also a problem with the data format. The National Audit Office provided the data as two CSV files. One contained the total budget of campaigns, the other listed all the donors. We had to combine these two, creating a file that contained three columns: donor, receiver and amount. If the politicians had used their own money, in our data format it looked like Politician A donated x euros to Politician A. Counter-intuitive perhaps, but it worked for Cytoscape.

When the data was cleaned and reformatted, we just ran it through Cytoscape. Then our graphics department made a full page page graphic out of it.

Finally we created a beautiful visualization on our http://www.vaaliraha.com/[website]. This was not a network analysis graphic. We wanted to give people an easy way to explore how much campaign funding there is and who gives it. The first view shows the distribution of funding between MPs. When you click on one MP, you get the breakdown of his or her funding. You can also vote on whether this particular donor is good or not. The visualization was made by Juha Rouvinen and Jukka Kokko, from an ad agency called Satumaa.

The web version of campaign funding visualization uses the same data as the network analysis.

*STEP FOUR: Publish the Data*

Of course, the National Audit Office already publishes the data, so there was no need to republish. But, as we had cleaned up the data and given it a better structure, we decided to publish it. We give out our data with a http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/[Creative Commons Attribution licence]. Subsequently several independent developers have made visualisations of the data, some of which we have published.

The tools we used for the project were: Excel and Google Refine for data cleaning and analysis, Cytoscape for network analysis, and Illustrator and Flash for the visualisations. The Flash should have been HTML5, but we ran out of time.

What did we learn? Perhaps the most important lesson was that data structures can be very hard. If the original data is not in suitable format, recalculating and converting it will take a lot of time.

=== Illinois School Report Cards (Brian Boyer, Chicago Tribune) ===

image::Figures/03-EE.png[width=600]

Each year, the Illinois State Board of Education releases school "report cards" -- data on the demographics and performance of all the public schools Illinois. It's a massive dataset, this year's drop was ~9,500 _columns_ wide.

The problem with that much data is choosing what to present. (As with any software project, the hard part is not _building_ the software, but building the _right_ software.)

We worked with the reporters and editor from the education team to choose the interesting data. (There's a lot of data out there that seems interesting but which a reporter will tell you is actually flawed or misleading.)

We also surveyed and interviewed folks with school-age kids in our newsroom. We did this because of an empathy gap -- nobody on the news apps team has school-age kids. Along the way, we learned much about our users and much about the usability (or lack thereof!) of the previous version of our schools site.

We aimed to design for a couple specific users and use cases: (1) parents with a child in school who want to know how their school measures up, and (2) parents who're trying to sort out where to live, since school quality often has a major impact on that decision.

The first time around, the schools site was about a six week, two developer project. Our 2011 update was a four week, two developer project. (There were actually three people actively working on the recent project, but none were full-time, so it adds up to about two.)

A key piece of this project was information design. Although we present far less data than is available, it's still a _lot_ of data, and making it digestible was a challenge. Luckily, we got to borrow someone from our graphics desk -- a designer who specialises in presenting complicated information. He taught us much about chart design and, in general, guided us to a presentation that is readable, but does not underestimate the reader's ability or desire to understand the numbers.

The site was built in Python and Django. The data is housed in MongoDB -- the schools data is heterogeneous and hierarchical, making it a poor fit for a relational database. (Otherwise we probably would have used PostgreSQL.)

We experimented for the first time with Twitter's Bootstrap user interface framework on this project, and were happy with the results. The charts are drawn with Flot.

The app is also home to the many stories about school performance that we've written. It acts as sort of a portal in that way -- when there's a new school performance story, we put it at the top of the app, alongside lists of schools relevant to the story. (And when a new story hits, readers of chicagotribune.com are directed to the app, not the story.)

Early reports are that readers love the schools app. The feedback we've received has been largely positive (or at least constructive!), and page views are through the roof. As a bonus, this data will remain interesting for a full year, so although we expect the hits to tail off as the schools stories fade from the homepage, our past experience is that readers have sought out this application year-round.

A few key ideas we took away from this project are:

1. The graphics desk is your friend. They're good at making complex information digestible.
2. Ask the newsroom for help. This is the second project for which we've conducted a newsroom-wide survey and interviews, and it's a great way to get the opinion of thoughtful people who, like our audience, are diverse in background and generally uncomfortable with computers.
3. Show your work! Much of our feedback has been requests for the data that the application. We've made a lot of the data publicly available via an API, and we will shortly release the stuff that we didn't think to include initially.

===  Mapa76 Hackathon (Mariano Blejman, Hacks/Hackers) ===

////

Insert picture from Mapa76 hackathon

////

We opened the http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersBA/[Buenos Aires chapter of Hacks/Hackers] in April 2011. We hosted two initial meetups to publicize the idea of greater collaboration between journalists and software developers, with between 120 and 150 people at each event. For a third meeting we had a 30-hour hackathon with eight people at a digital journalism conference in the city of Rosario, 300 kilometers from Buenos Aires.

A recurring theme in these meetings was the desire to scrape large volumes of data from the web, and then to represent it visually. To help with this a project called Mapa76.info was born, which helps users to extract data, and then to display it using maps and timelines. Not an easy task.

Why Mapa76? On March 24, 1976 there was a coup in Argentina, which lasted until 1983. In that period there were an estimated 30,000 disappeared people, thousands of deaths, and 500 children born in captivity appropriated for the military dictatorship. Over 30 years later, the number of people in Argentina convicted of crimes against humanity committed during the dictatorship amounts to 262 people (September 2011). Currently there are 14 ongoing trials and 7 with definite starting dates. There are 802 people in various open court cases.

These prosecutions generate large volumes of data that are difficult for researchers, journalists, human rights organisations, judges, prosecutors, and others to process. Data is produced in a distributed manner and investigators often don't take advantage of software tools to assist them with interpreting in. Ultimately this means that facts are often overlooked and hypotheses are often limited. Mapa76 is an investigative tool providing open access to this information for journalistic, legal, juridical, and historical purposes.

To prepare for the hackathon we created a platform which developers and journalists could use to collaborate on the day of the event. Martin Sarsale developed some basics algorithms to extract structured data from simple text documents. Some libraries were also used from DocumentCloud.org project, but not many. The platform would automatically analyse and extract names, dates and places from the texts - and would enable users to explore key facts about different cases (e.g. date of birth, place of arrest, alleged place of disappearance and so on).

Our goal was to provide a platform for the automatic extraction of data on the judgments of the military dictatorship in Argentina. We wanted to a way of automatically (or at least semi-automatically) displaying key data related to cases from 1976-1983 based on written evidence, arguments and judgments. The extracted data (names, places and dates) are collected, stored and can be analysed and refined by the researcher, as well as being explored using maps, timelines and network analysis tools. 

The project will allow journalists and investigators, prosecutors and witnesses to follow the story of a person's life, including the course of their captivity and subsequent disappearance or release. Where information is absent, users can comb through a vast number of documents for information which could be of possible relevance to the case.

For the hackathon, we made a public announcement through http://www.meetup.com/HacksHackersBA/[Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires], which then had around 200 members (at the time of writing there are around 540). We also contacted many Human Rights associations. The meeting was attended by about forty people including journalists, advocacy organisations, developers and designers.

During the hackathon, we identified tasks that different types of participants could pursue independently to help things run smoothly. For example, we asked designers to work on an interface that combining maps and timelines, we asked developers to look into ways of extracting structured data and algorithms to disambiguate names, and we asked journalists to look into what happened with specific people, to compare different versions of stories, and to comb through documents to tell stories about particular cases.

Probably the main problem we had after the hackathon was that our project was very ambitious, our short-term objectives were demanding, and it is hard to coordinate a loose-knit network of volunteers. Nearly everyone involved with the project had a busy day job and many also participated in other events and projects. Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires had 9 meetings in 2011.

The project is currently under active development. There is a core team of four people working with over a dozen collaborators. We have a http://groups.google.com/group/mapa76-dev/[public mailing list] and https://github.com/mapa76/[code repository] through which anyone can get involved with the project.

=== Electoral Hack in Realtime (Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires) ===

image::Figures/03-FF.png[width=600]

http://elecciones.hhba.info[Electoral Hack] is political analysis project that visualises data from the provisional ballot results of the 23 October 2011 elections in Argentina. The system also features information from previous elections and socio-demographic statistics from across the country. The project was updated in real time with information from the provisional ballot count of the national elections of 2011 in Argentina and gave summaries of election results. It was an initiative of Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires with the political analyst Andy Tow, and was a collaborative effort of journalists, developers, designers, analysts, political scientists, and others from the local chapter of Hacks/Hackers.

*What data did we use?*

All data came from official sources: the National Electoral Bureau provided access to data of the provisional count by Indra; the Department of the Interior provided information about elected posts and candidates from different political parties; a http://yoquierosaber.org/[university project] provided biographical information and the policy platforms of each presidential ticket; while socio-demographic information came from the 2001 National Census of Population and Housing (INDEC), the 2010 Census (INDEC), and from the Ministry of Health.

*How was it developed?*

The application was generated during the 2011 Election Hackathon by Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires the day before the election on October 23, 2011. The hackathon saw the participation of 30 volunteers with a variety of different backgrounds. Electoral Hack was developed as an open platform that could be improved over time. For the technology, we used Google Fusion Tables, Google Maps, and vector graphics libraries.

We worked on the construction of polygons for displaying geographic mapping and electoral demographics. Combining polygons in GIS software and geometries from public tables in Google Fusion Tables we generated tables with keys corresponding to the electoral database of the Ministry of Interior, Indra and sociodemographic data from INDEC. From this, we created visualizations in Google Maps.

Using the Google Maps API we published several thematic maps representing the spatial distribution of voting with different tones of color, where the intensity of colour represented the percentage of votes for the various presidential tickets in different administrative departments and polling stations, with particular emphasis on major urban centers: the City of Buenos Aires, the 24 districts of Greater Buenos Aires, the City of Cordoba, and Rosario.

We used the same technique to generate thematic maps of previous elections, namely the presidential primaries of 2011 and the election of 2007, as well as of the distribution of sociodemographic data, such as for poverty, child mortality, and living conditions, allowing for analysis and comparison. The project also showed the spatial distribution of the differences in percentage of votes obtained by each ticket in the general election of October compared to the August primary election.

Later, using partial data from the provisional ballot counts, we created an animated map depicting the anatomy of the count, in which the progress of the vote count is shown from the closing of the local polls until the following morning.

*Pros*

  * We set out to find and represent data and we were able to do that.  At hand we had the http://infoargentina.unicef.org.ar/[UNICEF's database of child sociodemographics], as well as the database of candidates created by the yoquierosaber.org group of Torcuato Di Tella University. During the hackathon we gathered a large volume of additional data that we did not end up including.

  * It was clear that the journalistic and programming work was enriched by scholarship. Without the contribution of Andy Tow and Hilario Moreno Campos, the project would have been impossible to achieve.

*Cons*

  * The sociodemographic data we could use was not up to date (most was from the 2001 census), and it was not very granular. For example, it did not include detail about local average GDP, main economic activity, education level, number of schools, doctors per capita, lots of other things that it would have been great to have.

  * Originally the system was intended as a tool that could be used to combine and display any arbitrary data, so that journalists could easily display data that interested them on the web. But we had to leave this for another time.

  * As the project was built by volunteers in a short time frame, it was impossible to do everything that we wanted to do. Nevertheless we made a lot of progress in the right direction.

  * For the same reason, all the collaborative work of 30 people ended up condensed into a single programmer when the data offered by the government began to appear, and we ran into some problems importing data in real time. These were solved within hours.

*Implications*

The Electoral Hack platform had a big impact in the media, with television, radio, print and online coverage. Maps from the project were used by several media platforms during the elections and in subsequent days. As the days went by, the maps and visualisations were updated, increasing traffic even more. On Election Day, the site created that very day received about 20 thousand unique visitors and its maps were reproduced on the cover page of the newspaper Página/12 for two consecutive days, as well as in articles in La Nacion. Some maps appeared in the print edition of the newspaper Clarín. It was the first time that an interactive display of real-time maps had been used in the history of Argentine journalism. In the central maps one could clearly see the overwhelming victory of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner by 54 percent of the vote, broken up by color saturation. It also served to help users understand specific cases where local candidates had landslide victories in the provinces.

=== The Guardian Datablog's Coverage of the UK Riots (Farida Vis, University of Leicester) ===

image::Figures/03-ZZ.png[width=600]

During the summer of 2011 the UK was hit by a wave of riots. Politicians suggested that these actions were categorically not linked to poverty and those that did the looting were simply criminals. The Guardian newspaper used data journalism to enable the public to better understand who was doing the looting and why.

By using simple maps they showed the location of http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/interactive/2011/aug/09/uk-riots-incident-map[confirmed riots spots] and through mashing up deprivation data with where the riots took place started debunking the main political narrative that there was no link to http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/aug/16/riots-poverty-map-suspects[poverty]. Both of these examples use off the shelf mapping tools and in the second example combine location data with another data set, to start making other connections and links.

A final example worth mentioning here is the visualization the paper built around the use of social media. Politicians had started to suggest that social media use might have to be curtailed during such troubles in future, but offering little concrete evidence that social media, Twitter in this case, played a role in encouraging people to riot. A visualization of riot related http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/aug/24/twitter-study-post-riot-plans#_[hashtags] used during this period, highlighted that Twitter was mainly used to respond to the riots rather than to organize people to go looting, with #riotcleanup showing the most significant spike during the riot period.

=== The Opportunity Gap (Scott Klein, ProPublica) ===

## A case study on one of the projects you're most proud of. The questions below give an indication of the sort of things that would be interesting to include in the case study:

[The Opportunity Gap](http://projects.propublica.org/schools)

## Describe the project and its major findings.

The Opportunity Gap used never-before-released U.S. Department of Education civil rights data and showed that some states, like Florida, have leveled the field and offer rich and poor students roughly equal access to high-level courses, while other states, like Kansas, Maryland and Oklahoma offer far less opportunity in districts with poorer families.

## What does the project aim to achieve?

## What data did you use and how did you obtain it? 

The data included all public schools in districts with 3,000 students or more. More than three-quarters of all public-school children were represented. A reporter in our newsroom obtained the data and our Computer Assisted Reporting Director, cleaned it very extensively.

## How long did you work on the project?

It was roughly a three-month project.

## How many people worked on it?

The story and news application combined, seven people: Two editors, a reporter, a CAR person, and two developers. Naturally we weren't all working on it exxclusively throughout that period.

## What were the skills necessary for this project? (e.g.: domain knowledge, coding, research, visualisation, etc.)

It really required our combined skills -- deep domain knowledge on the part of the reporter, the CAR person, and the developer;  design and coding skills on the part of the developer, etc. -- but more importantly an ability to find the story in data, and also to know what data that wasn't already in our data set might help readers understand the story and draw conclusions.

It also took editing -- not only for the story that went with it but for the news app itself. TK

## What techniques and tools did you use?

For the data cleaning and analysis we used mostly Excel and cleaning scripts, though we also used SQL Server CK. The news app is written in Ruby on Rails and uses JavaScript pretty exensively. 

## How did you present your story? (visualisations, maps, articles, etc.)

In addition to an overview story, our coverage included an interactive news application, which let readers understand and find examples within this large national data set that related to them. Using our news app, a reader could find their local school -- say, for example, [Central High School in Newark, N.J.](http://goo.gl/HJVCf)  -- and immediately see how well the school does in a wide variety of factors.  Then they could hit a button that says ["Compare to high and low poverty schools,"](http://goo.gl/WrAIi) and immediately see other high schools, their relative poverty, and the extent to which they offer higher math, Advanced Placement, and other important courses.  In our example, Central High is bookended by Millburn Sr. High. The Opportunity Gap shows how only 1% of Milburn students get Free or Reduced Price lunch but 72% of them are taking at least one AP course. In the other extreme, International High has 85% of its students getting Free/Reduced Price lunch and only 1% taking AP courses. 

Through this example a reader can use something they know -- a local high school -- to understand something they don't know -- the distribution of educational access, and the extent to which poverty is a predictor of that access in their area.

We also integrated the app with Facebook, so readers could log in to Facebook and our app would automatically let them know about schools that might interest them. 

## What were the results (e.g. in terms of traffic and interaction with the users, impact on policy, etc.)?

Traffic to all of our news apps are excellent, and we're particularly proud of the way this app tells a complex story -- and more to the point, helps readers tell their own particular story for themselves.

## What were the challenges of this project?

As with many projects that start with government data, the data needed a lot of cleaning. For instance, while there are 26 CK possible Advanced Placement coures, some schools reported having hundreds of them. This took lots of manual checking and phone calls to schools for confirmation and corrections.

We also worked really hard at making sure the app told a "far" story and a "near" story. That is, the app needed to present the reader with a broad, abstract national picture -- specifically, a way to compare how states did relative to each other on educational access. But given that abstraction sometimes leaves readers confused as to their own stake, we also wanted readers to be able to find their own local school and compare it to example high and low-poverty schools in their area.

## What advice would you give to aspiring data journalists based on this experience?

Same as I'd give to any journalist -- know the material and be inquisitive! All of the rules that apply to other kinds of journalism apply here. You have to get the facts right, make sure you tell the story, and crucuially, make sure your news app doesn't disagree with a story you're writing -- because if it does, one of the two might be wrong.
